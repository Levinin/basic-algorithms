# Simple Algorithms
A repository for simple algorithms in Python. Just learning and practicing some of these things.

## Sorting Algorithms
- Bubble Sort
- Quick Sort

## Search Algorithms
- Binary Search

The following three are almost identical. These are implemented as 
searches for a specific target and not as graph traversals.

- Dijkstra's 
- Greedy Search 
- A*

## Learning Algorithms
These are very similar, only the initial action and update rules really differ. 
Both use e-greedy for exploration.

Updated the q-learning with Double Q-learning and UCB exploration.
